Recognizing traffic signs is essential for safe driving and autonomous navigation. This project aims to create a deep learning system to accurately identify traffic signs using advanced methods. The system uses special convolutional blocks and connections to improve accuracy, especially in difficult conditions like bad weather or unclear signs. It focuses on enhancing driver safety and comfort in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
